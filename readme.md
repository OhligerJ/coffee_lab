# CoffeeScript Exercises

For this lab we would like you to complete the following exercises in CoffeeScript. You can do this in a Rails app or in a seperate coffee file.

### reverse()

Define a function `reverse()` that reverses a string. For example, `reverse("building")` should return the string `"gnidliub"`.

### filterLongWords()

Write a function `filterLongWords()` that takes an array of words and an integer `i` and returns an array of words that are longer than `i`.

### range()

Write a function `range` that takes one argument, a positive number, and returns an array containing all numbers from 0 up to and including the given number.

### startsWith

Write a function called `startsWith` that takes two arguments, both strings. It returns `true` when the first argument starts with the characters in the second argument, and `false` otherwise.

### grade()

Write a function named `assignGrade` that:

* takes 1 argument, a number score.
* returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".

Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

### pluralizer()

Write a function named `pluralize` that:

* takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
* returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".

Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

### tempConvert()

Store a celsius temperature into a variable. Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
